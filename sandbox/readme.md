Previews of what coming up in the next few days or weeks.



## [Elevations View Path]( https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/#sandbox/elevations-view-path/ )

The goal is to replay a journey in 3D. Take data recorded of a aircraft flight, a mountain hike or a bicycle adventure and replay the motion in space and time.

You can be an ommiscient observer looking down from on high. You could be seeing things from the eyes of the traveller. The camera itself becomes something to design.


## full screen: [Elevations View Fly]( https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/sandbox/elevations-view-fly/ )

You are Superwoman or Superman! You can fly like a bird. Or would you simply like to practice flying a drone?

This demo is very early stage - movements are flaky. But do enjoy it because things will never be as insane as this later on.
