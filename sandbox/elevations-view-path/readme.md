## full screen: [Elevations View Path]( https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/sandbox/elevations-view-path/ )

Load a path into the map and display it.

Have an object - soon to be an aircraft - moving along the path and have the camera follow the object.

While the camera is moving you control the direction where it's looking.
