## Concept: 3D maps on your home page


There are a great many apps for creating 2D maps. There are a few quite sophisticated apps for creating 3D maps. See Links of Interest below.

There are, however, few ways to get going with 3D mapping if you are an entry level coder.

There are a great many ways of linking and embedding maps from remote servers into web pages.
There are, however, few ways to get going with all the data and scripts on a static server - such as with [GitHub Pages]( https://pages.github.com/ ).

So, let's get going!

### Mission

* To supply numerous FOSS cookbook samples so as to make mapping as easy as baking a pie
* To demo how to access online data sources and mash-up new displays and visualizations from that data
* An investigation into writing very simple code that can access the [Google Maps API]( https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial )


### Vision

* To go where nobody has gone before


## Features

* The [Coding Style]( #coding-style.md ) used here could be of interest
* And the on-the-fly menu system as well



## Goals

* To anything Three.js can do - with a map
* To do anything a map can so - with added Three.js goodness


## Links of Interest

* [Google Maps API]( https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial )
* [Verne: The Himalayas[( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withgoogle.verne )

### Online 3D Map Making

* [Google Earth]( https://www.google.com/earth/ )
	* Note that home page shows static 2D images
* [Cesium]( https://cesiumjs.org/ )
	* 2016-08-04 ~ Note that home page demo appears to be broken
* [Web World Wind]( https://webworldwind.org/ )
	* Note that home page shows static 2D images

## Change Log
