Hi Everybody


My mission, as always, is to give peeps the tools to design their own fishing gear so they can catch their own fish so they have enough to eat. Replace fish with whatever.

Now I know you are not likely to design fishing gear, but you do eat fish.

If we are good fisherpeeps, then peeps like you have to able to command, savor and digest the results of our recipes.

This time its about the fishing maps.

Here is a link to one of the best maps - actually there's nothing fishy about it. Please do try to go to several of the locations.

[Elevations View]

And here is a link to lots more of the links. Please see if you can naviagate around.

There's no need to report bugs yet. There's a ton of fishy things I already know about. 

If, however, there's a serious crash or freeze on your device then please do let me know.

And, there's no real need for wish list ideas yet either, as I have a ton of new ideas to fish for.

But what would be fun is thinking about the lure we put at the end of the fishing line.

So can you fish around your brain for a quote we could but on the web site that would be alluring?
